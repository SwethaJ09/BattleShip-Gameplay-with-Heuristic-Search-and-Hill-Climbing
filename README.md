# Battleship Game with AI  

This project is a Python implementation of the classic Battleship game, enhanced with AI capabilities using heuristic search algorithms and hill climbing for strategic decision-making.  

## Features  
- **Randomized Ship Placement:** Ships are placed randomly with no overlaps.  
- **Turn-Based Gameplay:** Players take turns making moves, aiming to sink all opponent ships.  
- **AI Strategies:**  
  - *Random AI*: Chooses moves randomly.  
  - *Basic AI*: Considers hits, misses, and proximity to optimize moves.  
- **Interactive GUI:** Built with Pygame, offering an intuitive interface for players.
